This Tool will Automatically set the appropriate Windows Firewall Rules to Whitelist your Friends from the DigitalArc Guardian tool and prevent others from joining your session (if you are the host).
The Tool requires Admin privileges to Run, since it changes the Windows Firewall Rules. 
And you need to Enable the Firewall for the Rules to take effect.
